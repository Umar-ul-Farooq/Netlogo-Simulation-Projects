# NetLogo Agent-Based Models

This repository contains several agent-based models developed using NetLogo. Each model simulates specific scenarios to analyze and visualize emergent behaviors arising from simple agent interactions.

## Models Included

### 1. Traffic Flow Model
- **Purpose:** Simulates vehicle movement on a road to analyze traffic dynamics, congestion patterns, and effects of traffic density.
- **Features:** Adjustable traffic density, car acceleration, and visualization of traffic jams.

### 2. Termites Model
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates emergent behavior through termites' wood-chip gathering and stacking activities.
- **Features:** Randomly moving termites, wood-chip collection and deposition behavior, and formation of organized chip piles.

### 3. Oil Spill Model
- **Purpose:** Simulates oil spill percolation through soil, illustrating environmental impact and spread.
- **Features:** Adjustable soil permeability, spill size, and spread rate visualizations.

### 4. Bird Flocking Model
- **Purpose:** Illustrates flocking behavior of birds using simple alignment, cohesion, and separation rules.
- **Features:** Adjustable flock size, alignment strength, cohesion radius, and dynamic visualization of bird flocks.

### 5. Ants with Pheromones Model
- **Purpose:** Models ants' food foraging behavior using pheromone trails to locate and return to food sources.
- **Features:** Ant behavior based on chemical trail detection, adjustable population size, pheromone dissipation rate, visualization of food source depletion, and trail reinforcement.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:**
   - Download and install [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

2. **Running Models:**
   - Open NetLogo.
   - Load the model file (`.nlogo`) from the repository.
   - Click "Setup" to initialize the environment.
   - Click "Go" to start the simulation.

3. **Customization:**
   - Use provided sliders and buttons in each model to experiment with various parameters and observe their effects on agent behavior.
